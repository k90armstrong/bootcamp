                <h2><a href="https://vimeo.com/2975715" target="_blank">Bike Tour</a></h2>
                <p>In 2008, Blind Pilot did a very unique tour along the West Coast. Taking nothing but, their bikes, bike trailers, instruments and some necessities, not knowing where they would sleep at night, they headed down the coast playing at many small venues.  The band actually decided on the name "Blind Pilot" before leaving on the tour because they had not heard of anyone doing it before and felt as if they were flying into the unknown.  At the end of the tour, they recorded the album "3 Rounds and a Sound".</p>
